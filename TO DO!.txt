######## TO DO: #########
Module 1: Cleaning data:
For each column, group by continent and put median into NAs

Module 2: Find outliers: boxplots, bivariate plots.

Module 3: Present hight PC1, PC2 on the map, coloring countires

Module 5: EFA

Module 6: Clustering - between countires
- make hierarchical for countries, look how it looks like
- make k-means for countries and interprete it by PCA or centers
- plot a map for each group

Module 7: CFA



####### DONE: ########
Module 3. PCA : Asia is the most diverse continent. Africa the biggest in 
 child mortality and child per woman

Module 4. MDS: Asia again is the most diverse. Africa is opposite than Europe
USA and Canada s closer to Europe. Mexico closer to Central America

Module 6. Cluster between continents: interesting that Oceania is grouped with Africa.
the reason is that Oceania has Austrialia and NZ, but rest of countries are small islands
rather poor, so it's classified on the same lvl as Africa
