######## TO DO: #########

Module 3: Present hight PC1, PC2 on the map, coloring countires

Module 5: EFA
-Factor1: Developed countries, higher developed countries with more internet, phones, low mortality in children, low children per woman
-Factor2: Populated countries, obviously more population
-Factor3: Income/Gender, more men and more income
-Factor4: Gini/Murder, Higher inequality leading to more murder

Module 6: Clustering - between countires
- make hierarchical for countries, look how it looks like
<<<<<<< HEAD
- make k-means for countries and interprete it by PCA or centers
- plot a map for each group
Group1: high in murder and gini indicating high inequality leading to more murders
Group2: sex ratio is large (Qatar/UAE), Income per person is also large, Investment per GDP is also large, Phones per person
Group3: nothing really important, nothing above 0.5. Most significant is children mortality & children per woman is low, however we cannot say much about this group
Group4: Developed countries *high in suicide may be caused by developments in phones/internet/high_income
Group5: Big countries in both tot_pop & urban_pop 
(0.5 is something worth mentioning)
Group6: Poor countries (Mainly african countries) no internet, small population, lots of children per women, child mortality is high etc.

Module 7: CFA



####### DONE: ########
Module 1: Cleaning data:
For each column, group by continent and put median into NAs

Module 2: Find outliers: boxplots, bivariate plots.

Module 3. PCA : Asia is the most diverse continent. Africa the biggest in 
 child mortality and child per woman

Module 4. MDS: Asia again is the most diverse. Africa is opposite than Europe
USA and Canada s closer to Europe. Mexico closer to Central America

Module 5. EFA: Some countries are hidden in plot because of their size. 4 factors were identified; Developed (factor1), Crowded(factor2), Income/Gender (factor3), Inequality(factor4).

Module 6. Cluster between continents: interesting that Oceania is grouped with Africa.
the reason is that Oceania has Austrialia and NZ, but rest of countries are small islands
rather poor, so it's classified on the same lvl as Africa
#Make sense!

Module 6: Clustering - between countires
- make k-means for countries and interprete it by PCA or centers
- plot a map for each grou
- do model based clustering
- Match colors for k-means & model based
- compare results k-means with model based
