#I. Introduction: ROGELIO
<!-- Team clearly described the dataset and clearly described the motivation behind studying the data. Team provided -->
<!-- scholarly citations or quantitative facts to describe the motivation. -->

#II. Data Cleaning and Outlier Visualization: ROGELIO
<!-- Team clearly described their data cleaning and outlier removal process. Team presented insightful visualizations -->
<!-- motivating to do further exploratory or confirmatory analysis. -->

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE,dpi=300, fig.width=20,fig.height=11}
#PART 1: Read csv, merge, clean and plot outliers.
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(countrycode)
library(car)

source('Read_Clean.R')
cleaned <- Read_Clean()
```




#III. Dimension Reduction Analysis: MIKA & ME
<!-- Team applied dimension reduction analysis correctly and discussed the -->
<!-- motivation behind that. Also, they provided interesting insights into the -->
<!-- results. -->

The data set contains 17 variables. In order to easly present them, dimension reduction analysis were computed. Two techniques were used: Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).


##Part A: MDS -> MIKA
- ALL VARIABLES INCLUDED
-we can see Clusters
-Asia: we can see is the most spread out and has the most outliers, spreads across Africa to Europe 
-Africa is the opposite of Europe
-South America and North America are similar

```{r}
#PART 2: MDS
library(scatterplot3d)
```
![image](img/mds2_high_r.gif)


##Part B: Principal Components -> ME
```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300}
# PART 3: PCA
library(maptools)
library(pryr)
library(ggbiplot) #if the library is not present use the code below
#library(devtools)
#install_github("vqv/ggbiplot")
source('PCA.R')
(PrinCompPlot <- PCA(cleaned))
```
FROM PCA excluded are: pop_total, murder_pp, armed_pp, urban_pop_tot, investment_per_of_GDP
it is because they spoil correlation between variables and as such more PC would be needed to explain
the relation.

## PCA MEANING:
# PC1: Developed countries, HIGH loaded in: phones, life exp., less corrup., internet income 
# PC2: sex ratio is high, suicide low
# PC3: inequality is high

- ellipses to help visualize concentration of points. The size of ellipses is influenced by outlines.

- on the right we have develope countires: EU, North America where the most correlated are: less corruption, internet, life exp., phones, income.
- on the left have not as developed countries: Africa where Child mortality and children per woman and inequality is high.
-Asia is the most diverse continent (especially in PC2). It also has the highest sex ration (means more mean per woman). Super low PC2 for sex ration (Quatar, UAE)
- Central America & South are in the middle on the plot

- on PC1 & PC3 explain better Africa. (it is because PC3 is mostly about inequality and development)


#IV. CLUSTERING - ROGELIO
### PART A: Hierarchical Clustering between Continents

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, dpi=300, fig.width=11,fig.height=7}
# PART 3: Hierarchical Clustering between Continents
library(ape)
source('cluster_continents.R')
Cl_continents <- cluster_continents(cleaned)
```
Include all variables

South, North and Europe are very similar. AND C America, Asia, Oceania and Africa are similar. Interesting is Africa is clustered with Oceania (with include Australia and NZ but also many small island which push Oceania into level of Africa)


#PART B: K-means and Model-Based clustering between Conutries
Jereamy both
```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300}
# PART 4: K-means & Model Based Clustering between Countries
library(mclust)
source('clusters_countries.R')
Cl_countries <- clusters_countries(cleaned)
```

- compare chi.square test -> dependency between groups and continents. Model based groups are more similar to continents.

- model based (group7) difficult name (result for this group)
pop_total murder_pp armed_pp phones_p100 children_p_woman life_exp_yrs suicide_pp urban_pop_tot sex_ratio_p100
[1,] 239114394         0    0.011     146.317             2.07       78.053          0     118882678        148.681
     corruption_CPI internet_%of_pop child_mort_p1000 income_per_person investments_per_ofGDP   gini
[1,]         53.677           75.725           10.791          50579.31                29.942 39.722

- Developed countries are split into 3 groups.

- poor countries are the same in both models

- we lost "crowded" group from k-means. It transfoms into group 7 which describe high Income, Sex Ratio, Population, phones



# V. Exploratory Factor Analysis -MIKA
In order to find the number of factors, EFA was performed starting with 1 factor, increasing the number of factors until getting a value for RMSE lower than 0.05. Therefore, it was concluded that the optimal number of factors is four. Performing EFA with 4 factors, the loadings are:    

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300}
  
#PART 5: EFA
source('EFA.R')
EFA_loadings(cleaned)
```
From the loadings it can be interpreted:   
1.	Factor 1 has high life expectancy, internet access, balanced income per person and it is low in child mortality and children per women. For these reasons, represents the level of development of the country. 
2.	Factor 2 represents the level of population.
3.	Factor 3 represents inequality and murder. 
4.	Factor 4 represents the level of income related with the amount of men and women that the country has. 
In order to visualize these four factors graphically, the top 10 for each factorâ€™s scores was taken and create four groups of countries, where each factor has more relevance. The groups of countries are named according with the meaning of each factor as follows: 
Factor 1 -> Developed 
Factor 2 -> Crowed 
Factor 3 -> Inequality
Factor 4 -> Gender/Income 
These can be visualized in the following graph: 



```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300}
source('EFA.R')
groups = EFA_plot(cleaned)
```

Note: There are some countries such as Singapore or Qatar that are in the groups but are too small to show in the map. 

The countries in group 1 are:  

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300, , results='asis'}
library(knitr)
print(groups[1])
```

The countries in group 2 are:  

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300, , results='asis'}
library(knitr)
print(groups[2])
```


The countries in group 3 are:  

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300, , results='asis'}
library(knitr)
print(groups[3])
```

The countries in group 4 are:  

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=300, , results='asis'}
library(knitr)
print(groups[4])
```
